### Introduction
Buried in busy schedules and countless tasks, many people end up dropping their fitness goals throughout the year as they become busy and fall into a pattern. With work, school, or other commitments that demand attention and energy, following a fitness regiment on top of all that seems impossible. Due to lack of guidance and being able to visualize a clear path towards a set goal, many people drop their fitness goals before they can be properly realized. However, with a collected platform that offers help with schedule management, personalized goal tracking, networking, and an abundance of resources, Momentum offers a solution to these problems. Momentum serves as a guide for people towards their goals in ways that fit their lifestyle and schedule so that they can continue working towards their goals. By presenting a user-friendly platform that dynamically changes, Momentum is able to offer flexibility for users in how they set and achieve their goals.

### Purpose
Momentum is an open source platform that is designed to empower busy individuals to achieve their fitness goals and stay organized. By combining scheduling tools with fitness tracking and tools, Momentum aims to simplify wellness and productivity. Momentum is able to do this through:
- **Custom Fitness Plans**: Access to personalized workout routines tailored towards users’ needs/goals. Each user will have different goals and levels of fitness, Momentum serves to serve all demographics of users regardless of their fitness level and schedule. For example, a user who used to play sports before entering the workforce wants to stay around the same level of fitness. The user will receive a fitness plan that is more tailored to maintain their current level of fitness versus working towards a goal. This differs from another user who has never played a sport and wants to start building up their fitness. They will receive a more active fitness goal that fits into their schedule that aims them towards building up their fitness.
- **Streamlined Scheduling**: Being able to easily integrate workouts, meetings, and personal tasks together into a single calendar for easy access. With so many different schedules that focus on only work or personal events out there, Momentum serves to combine these schedules into one location for better management. Being able to visualize integrating work and personal events with a fitness plan allows for users to see a tangible goal for themselves throughout the day. For example, a 1 hour lunch break can be integrated with getting steps in for an office worker who spends most of the day sitting down.
- **Progress Tracking Database**: Monitoring achievements and milestones with detailed insights of users’ fitness and productivity metrics. Being able to see tangible results of goal tracking is important for both motivation and making sure that progress is being made. With metrics tracking performance and rate of change, users are able to receive feedback for what works and what doesn’t so that they can either change their goals or the way that they approach their goals.Through a dynamic database that stores users’ metrics and offer solutions for their goals, Momentum can offer accurate solutions and recommend helpful resources for each user that is personalized based on their information in the database.
- **Collaboration Friendly**: The ability to share plans and goals with friends, colleagues, or trainers to maintain accountability and push each other towards goals. Momentum recognizes the importance of teamwork and accountability when it comes to achieving goals, especially with fitness. Whether you’re sharing fitness goals with friends, coordinating schedules with colleagues, or working with a personal trainer, Momentum allows for seamless collaboration. Built-in social features encourage group goals and synced schedules to stay on track together. This fosters a sense of community and allows users’ to never feel alone on their paths towards their goals.y
- **Open Source Community**: An Open Source community allows for constant innovation and customization. Many benefits are available from a vast creative developer community that can input their opinions and expertise in making the platform more dynamic and user-friendly. This allows for more customization for users and developers, pushing new features and improving already existing functionalities. With this ability to collaborate, the community can continually drive Momentum forward to be a dynamic platform that meets a variety of users’ needs.

### Features
- **User Demographic**: From a student trying to find time between classes and homework to an office worker who can’t seem to find time in their busy schedule, personalized schedules and time management recommendations are available for a wide range of users. Users can input their demographic and how their schedules line up with their fitness goals and the platform will output a program that fits each individual’s needs.
- **Location**: Users will be able to access the platform from any location as long as they have access to a device. Through location services, the platform is able to provide location based recommendations for users to see what is trending in their area.
- **Goalset**: Users are able to input their goals into a database, whether they are personal, professional, or physical goals. They can also input how they prioritize their goals, allowing the platform to emphasize different goals and put more resources into scheduling around these goals. Each users’ goals will be different, the platform is able to prioritize and adapt to different users’ needs.
- **Availability Scheduling**: A simplified calendar that declutters and streamlines users’ agendas helps provide efficient scheduling and proactiveness. Users are able to input events or time blocks where rescheduling is not an option, and the platform will provide recommendations for what to fill the time in between these blocks with. From filling time during a break at work to figuring out what to do once users return home, the platform provides dynamic recommendations that fit users’ goals.
- **Social Network**: A social network feature integrated into the platform allows users to communicate with other users as well as physical trainers. A sense of community not only helps users encourage each other in reaching their goals, but also creates a space for open-source development of the platform itself. Users are able to build communities and interact with each other, no matter where they are.
- **Feedback**: With integrated metrics tracking through the database, users receive feedback at milestones that track their progress. Users are able to break down when they were most productive towards their goals, and where they were lacking. This feedback allows growth through tracking metrics, showing where users weaknesses can originate from.

### Target Audience
