### Purpose
The purpose of ShelfSmart is to provide a simple and efficient solution for managing groceries, meal planning, and food waste reduction. Many other grocery management apps lack the adequate flexibility that would appeal to busy people. ShelfSmart is designed to bridge these gaps by allowing users to quickly identify their grocery items and be alerted about their dates of expiration, which helps them generate automatic shopping lists for the things they will be in need of.
The app will streamline essential tasks like barcode scanning, inventory management, and meal planning, allowing users to reduce time spent on chores activities and focus on more important aspects of their daily lives. ShelfSmart will include features such as:
- Barcode Scanning: Add items to the digitized inventory by scanning barcodes of products
- Expiration Date Tracking: Receive notifications for foods that will expire soon
- Customizable Shopping Lists: Automatically generate lists based on pantry inventory and meal plans.

Security will also be a focus, with features like data encryption and user-controlled privacy settings, ensuring that personal data is protected. Through ShelfSmart, users will be empowered to take control of their grocery management and minimize food waste, contributing to more sustainable living.

### Target Audience
The app caters to:
- Young Professionals: People around 22-35 who often struggle with work/life balance. They need a fast and simple way to manage their groceries, meal plans, and shopping lists.
- Developers and Open Source Contributors: Developers, UI/UX designers, and software engineers who are passionate about contributing to open-source projects. They can help with maintaining the app and ensuring its continuous and collaborative growth on GitHub.

These target groups often lack the time or energy to dedicate to complex grocery management tasks and are looking for a solution that makes grocery shopping, planning, and tracking easier and faster.

### Strategy
The development strategy for ShelfSmart will follow agile methodologies, which allow for improvements based on user feedback and testing. Initially, the project will begin by gathering user requirements from potential users, followed by the creation of a basic prototype to test core features such as barcode scanning and expiration date notifications. As the app evolves, features will be continuously refined and expanded based on direct user input.

The app will adopt an open source development model on GitHub, allowing their users to access the app’s source code. In collaboration with the community, it opens opportunities to improve the app by fixing bugs. ShelfSmart will be under the GNU General Public License(GPL) because it is a widely recognized open source license that promotes collaboration and transparency.

Another challenge is ensuring data accuracy, as the app relies on a dependable database for barcode scanning and expiration date tracking. Keeping such a database comprehensive and up-to-date requires continuous validation and expansion, because of the variety of products and expiration patterns. To address this, ShelfSmart will establish partnerships with trusted third-party data providers to ensure access to high-quality and accurate product information. Additionally, leveraging community contributions and AI-driven methods to identify and fill data gaps can further enhance the database’s reliability and scope.

Finally, achieving strong user adoption and retention is a key challenge in the abundance of grocery and meal-planning apps in the app store. To stand out, ShelfSmart needs to have an intuitive user experience while clearly proving its value to the users. This can be solved with an engaging and efficient onboarding process to help users quickly learn the app’s features and ensure the interface is both user-friendly and visually appealing.
