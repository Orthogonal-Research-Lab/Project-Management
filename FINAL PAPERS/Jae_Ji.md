Jae Ji, FA2024

In this paper, I will present a project called GrabNGrocery, a location-based app designed to improve grocery shopping for college students, young adults, and underprivileged communities. This app will emphasize three key development principles: user-centered design, community-focused innovation, and sustainable workflow integration.

### Introduction 

In today’s fast-paced world, grocery shopping is often a time-consuming and stressful task, particularly for college students, young adults, and vulnerable populations. Balancing tight budgets, busy schedules, and trying to make healthier, cost-effective choices creates a challenging everyday routine for these groups. As a college student myself, I’ve experienced firsthand the struggles of managing grocery expenses, finding affordable ingredients, and navigating the challenges of cooking all on a tight schedule. These personal challenges inspired me to develop a solution that not only addresses my own needs but also supports others in similar situations, particularly underprivileged communities.
My project aims to create a revolutionary grocery shopping app that combines personalization, price transparency, and location-based convenience. By bridging the information gap between shoppers and local grocery stores, this app can empower users to efficiently find the best deals on ingredients and products they need. It also encourages informed decision-making, reduces food waste, and supports local businesses. Whether it’s a student trying to manage their grocery expenses, a young adult learning to cook for the first time, or someone on a limited income seeking deals, this app simplifies the process, making grocery shopping more accessible and efficient for all.

### Preliminary Research and User Insights

The development of GrabNGrocery is informed by a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing college students' adoption of mobile grocery shopping apps. As the researcher who conducted this separate study, I gathered data from undergraduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, focusing on financial, time-related, and design factors that impact students' decisions to use these apps. I chose college students to research as a sort of test sample. This section summarizes the findings from the study I conducted to further understand my target population before app development. The results are used to gain insight into the motivations and barriers students face when adopting mobile grocery shopping solutions.

#### User Needs and Pain Points

College students are a unique group in that they face significant financial constraints and time pressures for the first time in their lives, making mobile grocery shopping apps an appealing solution. My research found that out of a total sample size of 150 students, convenience (85 respondents) and time-saving (65 respondents) are the primary motivators for students using grocery apps. This aligns with existing literature as well (Frohlke & Pettersson, 2015), which emphasizes the need for simple, accessible solutions to manage grocery shopping within busy schedules. With students trying to balance academics, work, and social life, the ability to quickly order groceries without leaving campus or waiting in long lines is a major benefit. Financially, students often work with limited budgets, and discounts or promotions play a key role in app adoption, with 40 respondents identifying them as a major motivator. However, concerns about the quality of produce and delivery reliability, noted by 33.9% of participants, highlight the need for apps to build trust through transparent tracking systems and clear communication about product quality. Usability issues were also discussed, with respondents expressing frustration over app glitches, slow loading times, and difficult navigation. These challenges suggest that user experience is a major pain point, particularly for students who may not be as tech-savvy or patient with complex interfaces. The lack of accessibility features like voice navigation and larger text sizes further highlights the need for inclusive design. All of this information will guide GrabNGrocery's development, ensuring the app addresses these concerns through user-centered design and accessibility features, making it more inclusive and appealing to a wide range of students, including those with disabilities. 

#### Research Highlights

#### Target Audience and Demographics

The primary target demographic for GrabNGrocery consists of college students, a group that faces unique challenges in grocery shopping due to their financial constraints, busy schedules, and limited access to transportation. This study's findings show that while many students use mobile grocery apps weekly or monthly (35% and 33.8%, respectively), only a small percentage use them daily (12.1%). This suggests that while mobile apps are integrated into students' shopping routines, they are not yet an everyday necessity for most users compared to traditional shopping methods. The app’s design will aim to bridge this gap by offering features that make it an essential tool for regular use, such as personalized suggestions, time-saving reordering, and access to discounts.

Additionally, underprivileged communities, which also face barriers to affordable grocery access, will benefit from the app’s cost-effective and location-based features. By integrating community-driven innovations and supporting local businesses, GrabNGrocery can cater to students from diverse backgrounds, fostering greater accessibility to cheaper and healthier food options.

#### Sustainability and Long-Term Impact

The study also sheds light on the importance of sustainability, with many students becoming more aware of the environmental impact of their food choices. Future iterations of GrabNGrocery could incorporate sustainability features, such as suggestions for reducing food waste and sourcing locally produced goods. These features not only contribute to personal well-being but also align with the broader goals of community sustainability, a key value of GrabNGrocery’s mission.

### Project Management

Project management is an important aspect of any creative venture, regardless of the field or scale. A project is typically defined as “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.” Whether it involves developing a new app, constructing a community center, or launching a marketing campaign, every project is aimed at achieving a specific goal within a defined timeline. The process of bringing an idea to life requires more than just vision. It can only succeed with careful planning, coordination, and oversight.

Project management involves the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet the project’s requirements. It encompasses everything from the initial concept to the final delivery, ensuring that objectives are clearly defined, timelines are set, and resources are allocated effectively. Without proper project management, a project risks being delayed, going over budget, or failing to meet its objectives.

For this project, effective project management will ensure the app is developed on time, within budget, and with the features and functionalities that meet the needs of its target audience. This includes defining the project scope, organizing the development team, and efficiently managing the project timeline and resources. Additionally, project management will address any risks or obstacles that may arise during development, ensuring that the project stays on track and delivers a quality product. The responsibility for the successful completion of the project lies with the project manager, who coordinates all activities, resolves issues, and ensures that the project meets its intended goals.

### Key Principles

The development of this project is guided by three key principles of project management: workflow mapping, agile development, and user-centered design. These principles ensure that the app meets the needs of its target audience while maintaining an efficient and ever-growing development process.

One principle is workflow mapping. Workflow mapping involves breaking down a project into its smallest tasks and assigning clear responsibilities to team members. This process provides a detailed plan for tracking progress, managing resources, and identifying bottlenecks. While similar to a roadmap, which offers a high-level overview of project goals, a workflow dives into the detailed steps required to achieve these goals. By focusing on organizational improvement rather than exhaustive documentation, workflow mapping ensures that critical individuals, resources, and processes are aligned to meet project milestones. For this project, mapping workflows will help coordinate tasks such as data integration, feature development, and user testing, ensuring that each phase of the app’s creation is organized and efficient.

Another crucial principle is agile development. This approach to project management highlights flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Agile development allows the team to adapt to changing requirements or user feedback, ensuring the app evolves in line with the needs of its audience. By working in smaller, incremental cycles, the team can test features, address issues, and refine the app’s design, all while maintaining a steady pace of progress. This principle is especially relevant for a project like this, where user needs and market demands can shift rapidly.

### Workflow Mapping

Workflow mapping plays a critical role in the development and deployment of this project, ensuring that all tasks are organized, tracked, and executed efficiently. A workflow map serves as a blueprint, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable units while providing a clear view of the overall process. The workflow starts with research and ideation, progresses through development and testing phases, and culminates in user feedback and continuous updates.

My workflow map:

To begin, the workflow identifies initial stages such as researching target users and brainstorming design ideas based on their needs. From there, the process transitions to designing the app, where the user interface and key functionalities are drafted and refined. A crucial step follows, involving design approval from stakeholders or team leads. Once approved, the project advances to development, separated into two sprints that focus on both core features and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) development. Each sprint ensures step-by-step progress while allowing room for adjustments based on feedback or emerging priorities.

App development work ultimately leads to a prototype, which goes through performance and security testing to ensure it meets user and technical standards. A key decision point involves prototype approval. If issues arise, the team must loop back to refine the app prototype before proceeding. After successful testing, the app is submitted to app stores, followed by marketing preparations and launch. Post-launch, the workflow emphasizes monitoring app performance and collecting user feedback. If actionable feedback is identified, updates are pushed to improve the app iteratively. This process ensures that the app remains user-centered and continues to evolve based on real-world needs.

By clearly mapping out each phase of the project, this workflow provides a structured and flexible foundation for managing development tasks, coordinating teams, and maintaining accountability. It also highlights key decisive points, such as design and prototype approvals, which ensure the app meets its intended goals at every stage. This level of organization enables the team to focus on delivering a high-quality, accessible app while adapting to feedback and unforeseen challenges.


### Managing Technical Debt 

Creating a grocery app for students will inevitably gather some technical debt, but the plan is to take a strategic approach to minimize this debt. By selecting tools and technologies with consideration for scalability, maintainability, and user experience, we can anticipate moderate technical debt accrual. Specifically, there should be about 10-20% additional development time due to integration complexities with payment gateways and mapping services, and 5-10% additional maintenance time due to potential versioning issues with dependencies. 

To minimize technical debt, the ideal strategy for this project focuses on proactive measures. Automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be implemented to detect integration issues and regressions. Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions ensure that emerging technical debt is addressed efficiently. Additionally, maintaining detailed documentation and encouraging knowledge sharing among team members facilitates smooth maintenance and future upgrades. By utilizing cloud-based services, open-source libraries, and modular architecture, the initial technical debt is minimized, ensuring a seamless and intuitive grocery shopping experience for students.

Thinking into the next 5 years, the technology behind the grocery app may require costly updates and changes over the years to maintain efficiency, security, and scalability. Initial costs could range from $10,000 to $20,000 for updating React Native and Node.js, essential for the app's functionality. Additionally, the database (MongoDB) will need to be expanded to accommodate increased user traffic, with estimated costs between $5,000 and $10,000. Cloud hosting costs (AWS) will also rise as the user base grows, adding $5,000 to $10,000 annually.

As new versions of iPhone and Android devices are released, the app will need to be adapted for compatibility, potentially requiring significant rewrites costing between $20,000 and $40,000. Enhancing security measures to protect user data will also be critical, with associated costs ranging from $10,000 to $20,000. These updates will ensure the app operates smoothly and maintain user trust. Looking further ahead, an overhaul of the architecture may be necessary to support rapid growth, with costs ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. This may involve replacing outdated technologies ($20,000 to $40,000) and investing in team training ($10,000 to $20,000) to keep up with the latest advancements. To mitigate these costs and reduce technical debt, flexibility, automated testing, and regular code reviews will be prioritized, ensuring the app remains maintainable and successful.

### Community Building

A key principle in the success of any app development project, including ours, is community building. A strong community fosters collaboration, improves the product through shared feedback, and sustains long-term growth. For this project, it is essential to differentiate between the user base and the community. 

The user base will primarily consist of individuals who will use the app in their daily lives. For example, users may include students, working professionals, or individuals with specific needs related to grocery shopping. They will engage with the app for its functionality, such as managing grocery lists, tracking expenses, or accessing recipes. This group provides essential feedback about user experience, app performance, and desired features.

The community, on the other hand, refers to developers, designers, and contributors who help maintain, improve, and innovate the app. Developers may contribute through coding new features, fixing bugs, or enhancing performance, while designers can provide improvements to the user interface (UI) and overall accessibility. Contributors such as accessibility advocates or UX specialists can also ensure the app aligns with inclusivity standards.

To effectively build and sustain the app’s community, we propose the following strategies:

- Clear Communication Channels

Open communication channels are essential for fostering collaboration among developers and connecting with users. We will utilize GitHub as the primary platform for project contributions, issue tracking, and backlog management. A dedicated Discord server will facilitate real-time communication through team-based text and voice channels, providing a space for development discussions, Q&A sessions, and community bonding. For the user base, we can establish a Facebook page or feedback forum where users can share experiences, suggestions, and concerns.

- Accessible Documentation
  
Comprehensive and accessible documentation is important for engaging contributors and onboarding new users. For contributors, a detailed README file will outline the app’s purpose, instructions for setting up the development environment, and guidelines for submitting contributions. Additional documentation will include an FAQ section and step-by-step guides for tackling common development tasks. For users, in-app tutorials and a user manual will explain core features and app navigation, ensuring the app is intuitive and easy to use.

- Community Engagement and Recognition

Building a sense of community requires active engagement and recognition. Contributors who make significant improvements, such as developing a key feature or addressing critical bugs, will be publicly recognized on GitHub or within the Discord community. To incentivize participation, we will organize events like virtual hackathons or coding challenges. These events will encourage innovation and provide opportunities for developers to collaborate. For users, surveys, feedback campaigns, and beta testing programs will give them a voice in shaping the app’s development.
