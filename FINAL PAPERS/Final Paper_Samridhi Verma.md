## Introduction

### Background

College housing markets are often fraught with challenges, such as restrictive lease terms, inflated prices, and a lack of visibility for smaller landlords. As a student, I’ve personally experienced the stress of navigating this fragmented system. Inspired by these difficulties, I propose a digital platform that consolidates housing options into one seamless experience, enabling students to make informed decisions and giving smaller landlords a competitive edge. This app—leveraging modern technology and user-centric design—seeks to democratize housing access and improve market efficiency.

Drawing inspiration from "Producing Open Source Software" by Karl Fogel, the project embraces iterative, transparent development practices. Additionally, it aligns with Adrienne Watt’s emphasis on defining clear project scopes and stakeholder involvement to address real-world problems effectively.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the housing search process for students while empowering smaller landlords by leveling the playing field. The platform aims to offer transparency in pricing, stress-free lease tracking, and real-time updates. Furthermore, by incorporating Agile methodologies as outlined in the PMI’s Agile Practice Guide, the project emphasizes iterative development, stakeholder collaboration, and continuous improvement. Finally, the app seeks to outpace competitors by integrating unique features such as roommate matching, community forums, and enhanced user engagement tools, ensuring a differentiated market presence.

## Development and Collaborative Approach

### Development Philosophy

- **Modular and Scalable Design**: Ensures adaptability for future updates and growth.
- **Usability Focus**: Prioritizes intuitive navigation and user-centric features.
- **Agile Methodology**: Employs iterative sprints, incorporating user feedback at every stage.

### Collaborative Features

- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Regular engagement with students and landlords during beta testing ensures the platform addresses real-world needs.
- **Proprietary and Collaborative Elements**: Sensitive features, such as lease management, are proprietary, while non-sensitive features, like filters, are open to public feedback.
- **Community Engagement**: Inspired by Mozilla’s "Community Engagement Playbook," we’ll foster active user participation through forums and hackathons.

### Competitor Analysis and Differentiation

- The app distinguishes itself by combining transparency, user-centric features, and community engagement. Unlike traditional listing platforms, this app prioritizes tailored recommendations and advanced tools like roommate matching and virtual tours.
