Focused on accessibility, it provides interactive tools like guided breathing exercises, gratitude jars, and story-based activities to teach social-emotional skills. The development follows a structured workflow, utilizing open-source collaboration on GitHub to engage contributors, including developers, educators, and caregivers to enhance its functionality and scalability. EmoHub aims to build a supportive community by sharing resources and creating a space where the audience can connect and share experiences to drive continuous improvement.
## Introduction
As someone interested in the UX field, I wanted to create an app with an accessibility focus. Accessibility is no longer just an optional feature in digital design, it is becoming a standard expectation for UX designers. This shift is driven by increasing awareness of the diverse needs of users and growing push to create more inclusive digital experiences. That sparked my idea of creating an app for children with emotional regulation difficulties like with ADHD, autism, or anxiety. Emotional regulation can be especially difficult for these children, and impacts their ability to cope with everyday situations, interact socially or focus on tasks. I wanted to create a tool that could help them navigate their feelings and find ways to relax. I named the app EmoHub and it would include features like guided breathing exercises, a gratitude jar and interactive story games that teach social-emotional skills.
## Purpose
The purpose of EmoHub is an open-source project to support children with emotional regulation challenges, such as those with ADHD, autism, or anxiety by providing them with tools and activities to help them understand and navigate their emotions. It is a safe, engaging, and accessible space where children can build emotional learning skills, improve their well-being, and enhance their confidence in managing everyday challenges. EmoHub will encourage collaboration through an open workspace, where contributors can propose features, submit pull requests, and engage in discussions about functionality and insights from their experiences with their children (offering feedback on what strategies and tools have worked best in supporting emotional regulation). Contributors could be developers, educators and parents. By managing EmoHub as an open-source project, the goal is to create an effective tool for emotional regulation and also create a community on making a positive impact on children’s lives.
## Target audience and Community
The main target audience for Emohub are children with emotional regulation challenges, parents, caregivers, educators and therapists. The app is designed to provide tools for children, specifically those with ADHD, autism or anxiety for their unique needs and build emotional regulation skills. Parents and caregivers are important in guiding their children for emotional growth. EmoHub gives them an accessible resource to help their children develop emotional skills that they can use to reinforce learning at home. Professionals working with children can also use EmoHub as a supplemental tool. The app provides structured exercises and engaging activities for teaching emotional regulation. This can build a community through an open-source platform, the collaborative workspace will allow contributors to exchange ideas and share experiences. These discussions can help identify areas for improvement and ideas for new features or adjustments to existing ones.
## Project Plan
![image of project plan,a structured workflow based on the waterfall method](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/blob/main/FINAL%20PAPERS/Screenshot%202024-12-16%20at%202.58.32%20PM.png)
Ideally, this project would follow a structured workflow based on the waterfall method, which outlines a clear time scale and development phases for EmoHub. (Link to workflow map, might be easier to see here & zoom in on: https://www.figma.com/board/ER9RuQBrO3JfI8ggfNsHZd/Reflection-%233?node-id=0-1&t=kacq5rZoMdxBhKMF-1 ). This is a framework to ensure each phase is thoroughly completed before moving to the next to minimize risks and ensure quality. 
The first phase is research (week 1), which I will briefly go over the secondary research and insights to find key features for the app later. But this phase explores the problem space, focusing on understanding the needs of children with emotional regulation challenges. This includes getting insights through secondary research, reviewing existing tools, and identifying key pain points and opportunities. It focuses on understanding the needs of children with emotional regulation challenges.
The next phase is design (week 2-3), which applies design principles to guide the wireframes and prototypes for EmoHub. Key aspects of this phase are initial brainstorming of features and review of wireframes with potential users or experts for feedback. The focus is on aligning the design with insights from the research phase to ensure it is effective for the target audience.
Moving on is development (week 4-6), it transitions EmoHub from design to implementation. It involves the development of the core structure of the app and coding implementing the app’s features. Collaboration with the open-source community can play a significant role here, allowing contributors to refine code and propose additional features.
Then there is user testing (week 7), usability testing is performed with children struggling with emotional challenges to test engagement, task completion rates, accessibility and emotional impact. This is to ensure the app meets user needs and expectations. Any technical or design issues are also identified in this phase. 
The following weeks are the refinement phase (weeks 8-10) to make adjustments based on identified flaws and user testing feedback to optimize EmoHub’s features and functionality. This phase includes finalizing designs and coding them to prepare for launch to ensure the app is intuitive and inclusive.
The last phase is launch and maintenance (week 11 and beyond) and EmoHub becomes accessible to its target audience. The app is officially launched on platforms like Google Play and the App Store, making it accessible to its target audience. Post-launch, a maintenance plan is implemented to address any issues that arise, introduce updates, and incorporate new features suggested by the community. Continuous monitoring and engagement with the open-source community ensures EmoHub evolves to remain relevant and impactful.
Although this workflow map develops EmoHub in a structured approach, if unexpected challenges or additional time in any phase is needed, there can be adaptation and flexibility. It is important to consider the development process may not be linear and can be impacted by unexpected obstacles to be prepared.
## Background Research and Key Features
To develop features for Emohub, I wanted them to be user centered and real solutions that would be helpful to the target audience. The focus is on helping children with emotional regulation challenges, like ADHD, autism and anxiety. So I did some secondary research on these kids to get a better understanding of the challenges and behaviors that kids face to find solutions that would cater to their pain points and needs. I reviewed 6 sources and found four main insights which are that kids with ADHD or autism often struggle to calm down after becoming upset and may need longer recovery times. Encouraging positive emotions like gratitude, pride, and compassion is more effective for long-term emotional control. Children with ADHD and autism are highly visual learners and struggle with identifying their emotions. Emotional regulation is a learned skill that improves with practice. These insights are important to develop solutions and features that would be beneficial to the target audience and not just ideas I thought would help. 
This helped me develop a how might we question to ideate features for Emohub: How might we design an interactive tool that helps children with emotional dysregulation identify, express, and regulate their emotions, while providing calming activities and positive reinforcement for long-term emotional control? Although this question may seem long, it captures the essence of the challenge by focusing on the key insights about children with emotional challenges. It emphasizes the need for a tool that genuinely helps children with emotional regulation difficulties.
The insights from this research shifted my initial idea of features like a mood tracker. Rather the features should be on tools with visual learning and positive emotion reinforcement that would be more impactful for children facing these challenges. Features that would address the insights and needs of children with emotional challenges are a gratitude jar, where children can visually track positive experiences. Guided breathing exercises with visual cues to help children calm down. And having interactive stories, story-based activities that teach social and emotional skills. 
## Strategy
To create a scalable and community-driven app, EmoHub will adopt an open-source development model hosted on GitHub which allows for the app’s source code to be accessible to developers, educators, parents, and other contributors. The collaboration from the community will enhance the app's features, address bugs and continuously improve its functionality. Hosting the project on GitHub provides a centralized platform for version control, issue tracking and pull requests, enabling contributors to propose updates and share insights.
For the front end development, EmoHub will be built using JavaScript to allow for an adaptable and responsive design to meet the needs of the children. This will ensure the app is interactive and visually appealing. JavaScript will manage the app’s layout, features like interactive stories, the gratitude jar, and guided breathing exercises, as well as the overall user experience for the target audience. The goal is to make the interface intuitive and easy to navigate for children with emotional regulation difficulties.
The back end of EmoHub will have user data, profiles, social groups, comments, messaging, posts, and user authentication. The back-end will be developed using Python to manage features like logging in, storing emotional regulation progress, user interaction in groups and securely storing personal data. This supports scalability and performance to ensure the app can handle an increasing number of users over time. SQL will be used to manage the data structure for EmoHub. It can store and retrieve data efficiently for the app. 
The licensing for Emohub will be under GNU General Public License (GPL). It is a widely recognized open-source license that promotes collaboration and transparency. This will preserve the project’s collaborative nature and ensure it remains accessible to everyone. 
By utilizing open-source principles, EmoHub will provide a flexible and transparent platform for collaboration and aligned with the needs of its users. This approach allows for the app to be accessible and adaptable. 
## Support and Maintenance
To ensure the long-term functionality for EmoHub, there will be a need for continuous improvements, updates, and active community engagement. There will be ongoing maintenance that involves regular bug fixes and updates to ensure the app performs well and has no technical issues. These updates will also include compatibility enhancements to keep the app functional with the latest iOS and Android versions. There will also be performance monitoring to focus on metrics such as load times, server response rates, and user activity to identify areas for improvement.
Community support is also important to EmoHub. The forums and social features like messaging and social groups, will have active moderation to ensure a safe and supportive environment. User feedback will play a vital role in guiding EmoHub’s development. Regular surveys will be conducted to gather insights from parents, educators, and therapists to help identify strengths and areas for improvement. A feature roadmap based on feedback will guide updates to meet user needs, helping EmoHub grow and improve over time.
Sustainability will be a key focus for EmoHub’s long-term maintenance. For that, funding will be needed. There could be funding options like grants and sponsorships from organizations that share the app’s mission to support children’s mental health. Possibile having premium features while keeping the core app free and open-source could provide additional revenue. Community donations may also be accepted to fund server costs, development efforts, and ongoing improvements.
## Conclusion 
This project allowed me to incorporate key UX practices, such as user-centered design, developing solutions based on user insights and needs and framing a "how might we" question to guide ideation. Moving forward, EmoHub can be expanded with additional features and improvements based on user feedback and evolving needs. Accessibility can be further enhanced by incorporating multiple languages and text-to-speech options. Also building partnerships with schools and organizations supporting children with special needs could be future goals. Collaborating with these institutions can provide access to valuable feedback from those who work with these children on a daily basis. They can also help integrate EmoHub into educational and therapeutic settings, enhancing its impact as a tool for emotional regulation. Through these developments, EmoHub can continue to evolve into an inclusive tool that empowers children and supports their caregivers.
