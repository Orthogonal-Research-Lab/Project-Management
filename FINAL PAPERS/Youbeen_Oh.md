This allows us to identify key topics such as food quality, service, ambiance, and value for money.
The goal of ARISE is to empower users with a summarized yet comprehensive overview of customer feedback, enabling them to make informed dining choices without the need to manually look through countless reviews. By presenting sentiments and recurring themes through intuitive visualizations and concise summaries, ARISE streamlines decision-making for diners seeking recommendations, regardless of their location. Additionally, restaurant owners can leverage these insights to identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.
Our project incorporates state-of-the-art tools and methods to ensure accurate sentiment classification and clustering, with plans for deployment on an accessible web or mobile platform. By supporting location-based input, ARISE offers a scalable and user-friendly solution that bridges the gap between raw customer opinions and actionable insights, enhancing dining experiences globally.

### Purpose
Travelers and diners often face challenges when choosing the right restaurant, especially in unfamiliar locations. The abundance of reviews on platforms like Google Maps can be overwhelming, and the need to sift through vast amounts of text to find the best dining experience can be time-consuming. Moreover, the reviews that are displayed to users may not always reflect the full spectrum of customer experiences, with some reviews being filtered or hidden, leading to biased or incomplete impressions.
The purpose of ARISE: AI Restaurant Insights using Sentiment Evaluation is to address these challenges by providing an easy-to-use platform that helps users quickly find the optimal restaurant based on aggregated and analyzed customer feedback. Rather than browsing through countless individual reviews, our platform presents a clear overview of customer sentiment and key themes, allowing users to make more informed decisions based on real-time data.
By utilizing sentiment analysis and text clustering, ARISE ensures that every review is considered and categorized, providing a comprehensive picture of the restaurant's strengths and weaknesses. Our goal is to eliminate the uncertainty often associated with restaurant reviews and give customers a reliable, data-driven way to evaluate dining options. This is particularly useful for travelers who are unfamiliar with the area and need a trusted guide to help them find the best dining experiences suited to their preferences.

### Features
**Location Input**
