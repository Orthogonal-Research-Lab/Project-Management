### Introduction
Many UIUC students have to struggle to find reliable restaurant information that is focused on students. For example, most general platforms like Google Reviews or Yelp don’t specifically focus on the UIUC community in terms of budget, food preference, and proximity to UIUC’s hidden hotspots. Also this information might be spread out on various platforms, making students navigate through several sources before finding a relevant dining option. 

The absence of a centralized, student based platform inspired the development of this website, which classifies UIUC restaurants by key factors: cuisine, location, budget, and even dietary options. The goal of this website is to streamline dining decisions by consolidating information in one place, allowing students easier access to dining information and improving campus experience.  

This project adopts open source and working open principles of transparency, collaboration, and community contribution. Contributory opportunities will be given to students, residents of Urbana-Champaign residents, and even the restaurant owners through writing reviews, filling in restaurant details, and suggesting improvements to the platform. This collaborative approach ensures that the platform stays relevant and current, while it also builds a sense of ownership in the community. 

This project bridges the gap in accessible and reliable dining information for UIUC students by creating a student centered restaurant categorization website. This platform would work as a source for streamlining dining decisions and cultivating an active community of users who contribute and engage with each other. Ultimately, it has the potential to enhance student life, connecting and making lives easier within the Urbana Champaign area.  

### Headings and Subjeadings 

#### Background and Rationale
The variety and availability of food become very important for students living in Champaign, which is a considerably rural campus town. Unlike metropolitan cities, there aren't many activities available in Champaign other than the routine of attending classes, eating, and coffee chats. For many students, food becomes not just a necessity but a primary source of enjoyment and stress relief factor. Personally, the choice of what to eat for lunch or dinner has always been a stress relief factor, and I’m confident that other students feel the same way. This makes the UIUC students’s access and diversity of food choices much more significant than students living in more urbanized areas. 

Initially, my open source project idea was to create an Instagram account for restaurant reviews in Champaign targeting UIUC students and local residents. The Instagram page was supposed to focus on unique aspects such as student friendly pricing, convenient locations, and study spots. However, as the project progressed, I came to realize that an Instagram page possesses inherent limitations compared to a website. For example, an advanced search function is missing on instagram: filtering restaurants based on categories like cuisine type, dietary preferences, or budget, along with viewing options, or navigation on the map. It is also harder to organize user generated content on Instagram because instagram functions as a visual timeline, not an interactive media. Those constraints might make instagram less effective for people who want to find information quickly and conveniently. 

Given these limitations, I transformed the project to developing a website. Creating a website allows more development of features such as flexibilities, deeper filters, search functions, or having more structured and accessible incorporation of user generated content. This transition corresponds with the goal of creating a centralized and comprehensive resource, by allowing users to research various dining options in Champaign, therefore helping them make informed decisions about dining and enhancing their overall experience within the community. 

#### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to build a convenient website for advertising restaurants in Urbana Champaign, depending on cuisine, price range, dietary preferences, and distance from campus. The website will provide recommendations and reviews from other consumers, which would simplify the decision making process when students are choosing dining options. 

This open source project enables the community to participate by providing reviews, ratings and restaurant entries. Through active community engagement and feedback, the website will sustain its relevance and effectiveness in meeting the needs of students and improve their campus experience. 

### Implementation and Management

#### Platform Design
For my platform development, I chose Weebly as the most significant tool in both designing and creating the website. Weebly is an intelligent, user-friendly website builder that offers the ability to create a homepage without expert knowledge in coding. The interface is intuitive, easy to use, and consists of drag and drop elements, which allowed me to concentrate on the user experience aspect rather than being challenged by technical difficulties. 

One of the strongest features of Weebly is the App Center, where you can find many plugins to extend the functionality of the website. Using the App Center, I have added various features such as forms, SEO tools, or e-commerce elements to develop the website. It also has a wider choice of templates that can be edited to fit the specific branding of UIUC Bites. Therefore, I can select the appropriate fonts, colours and layouts to make the website more attractive to the target audience. 

#### Core Features of the Website
1. **User Generated Content**: Through UIUC Bites, users can post comments, ratings and posting pictures of restaurants around the UIUC Campus. This feature achieves the purpose of making people engage and making people feel like they belong to this community as well as receive useful information. 
2. **Restaurant Reviews and Guides**: Articles and lists containing titles like, ‘5 Must Try Restaurants Near UIUC’, ‘5 Best Budget Friendly Eats On Campus’ are made for UIUC students and residents.
3. **Community Engagement**: A ‘Community page enables users to share their favorite places, reply to the blog posts or talk about restaurant information.
4. **Interactive Design**: This website contains appealing graphic features such as proper image of foods and subgroup sections like “Budget Eats”, “Top Rated” etc. Clear organization of the website and easy navigation enables users to come across the information they are searching for. 
5. **Social Media Integration**: Below the blog postings, there are links to the UIUC Bites’ social media accounts that provide information of new posts, featured restaurants, and updates.
6. **Responsive and Accessible Design**: This website supports both desktop and mobile apps versions. Furthermore, this website uses proper organization, clean layouts of the content to help with easy navigation
7. **Customizable Features**: Using Weebly, I can easily edit fonts, colors, and layouts to remain relevant to the platform’s requirements. Other additional tools such as apps or other plugins are also available to maintain the scale and versatility of the platform.

#### Open Source Principles
The concept of open source principles provides a framework to the project vision and progressive development of UIUC Bites as a community driven, transparent, and adaptive project. Both the content approach and the principles targeting the likes of users are shaped by these values. 

1. **Collaboration and Community-Driven Content**: Open source places significant importance to collaboration and this project extends this idea by requiring users submit restaurant reviews, ratings and photos. Given the fact that the users are the ones that post content, the website builds a concept of collaboration and community engagement. This makes the content stay relevant, distinctive as well as reflecting on real life experience of students and residents of the Urbana Champaign area.
2. **Transparency and Shared Knowledge**:The idea of open source is to work on something that is transparent such that information can be shared, and this aligns with the project goal: to be able to post opinions about restaurants without focusing on commercial interests of the online platform. That way, both user generated reviews and the articles in UIUC Bites are credible and legitimate.
3. **Adaptability and Continuous Improvement**: Like any Open Source project, this whole platform is meant to grow and evolve with the feedback provided by its users. Functions like discussion forums and joining the SNS community means that this platform remains open with the ability to change over time depending on the users’ preferences.
4. **Accessibility and Inclusion**:According to Open Source principles, the accessibility of tools and platforms must be available for everyone. UIUC Bites is intended to be compatible with all methods of access and perception to reflect the diversity of the UIUC population.
5. **Empowerment Through Sharing**:In its essence, open source principle is the ability to make users more informed. UIUC Bites is a perfect example as it provides the UIUC students and residents with information for best dining experiences. This platform is a contribution tool where users posts their content’s ideas that are beneficial to other users and creating a feedback loop.

### Workflow 
![CI_CD Diagram-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7f66a54-bf95-4228-85d0-1e3fd90008ba)
To manage the project of UIUC Bites easily, there is a roadmap that outlines the status of the project. During phase 0, I concentrated on defining the audience, studying competitors, and coming up with the concepts of innovation such as food critiques and community. In the second phase, I chose Weebly as the site building tool, defined the layout of the homepage, and created some of the main content pages including Home, Blog, About Pages, and initial branding with logos and choosing the colour scheme. During phase 3, I made and published starters of such content as restaurant reviews, money saving tips and high quality images to interact with the users. 

For the future steps involved in the management of this platform, I will engage with UIUC groups, social media platforms, and various student clubs for platform growth and gather user feedback. In the future, I will also continue posting new contents and make relevant postings fitted on future trends. I will also track users’ activity by using Google analytics. For the final phase, I intend to continue the increase of community activity through integration of user generated reviews and featuring promotions with local restaurants to keep the platform both informative and engaging with the audience.

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Potential Challenges 
Creating a platform that relies on community engagement and dynamic information brings several challenges. 

1. **Lack of Participation**: The commitment to receiving frequent contributions from the community can be challenging since users can be reluctant when reciting no tangible quality in return for their participation.
2. **Content Moderation**: A major drawback of user generated content is that it often contains information that is less accurate, spam, or posts containing profanity,  therefore polluting the website.
3. **Data Accuracy and Updates**: Another challenge is to ensure the restaurant’s information, menus, hours of operation and other information is accurate and up to date.

#### Proposed Solutions 
To address these challenges, I propose three solutions. 

1. **Incentivizing Participation**: To increase user engagement in this platform , the platform will provide incentives like gift cards, posting the top contributors, and providing badges to users. This would develop a notion of getting reward and maintain users’ interest in participation.
2. **Content Moderation Policies**: There will be clear rules of content moderation to guarantee the platform's credibility. This will consist of the usage of automated filters along with actual human moderators to make certain that the user participation is both relevant and of decent quality.
3. **Automating Data Updates**: This will also lead to rely on APIs to provide automated update of items such as menus and operations during certain holidays to reduce the need for manual entry and prevent incorrect information.

### Conclusion and Value 
This project will bring huge value to the students in terms of improving their experience of dining by creating a streamlined, student centric platform for restaurant reviews, guides, and ratings. This kind of personalized approach not only eases the process of making dining decisions but also guarantees that the recommendations will be focused towards unique preferences and needs of the university community. 

This project creates active community engagement, which allows users to contribute reviews, ratings, and photos to create a collaborative and informed environment. This participative model ultimately leads to transparency and trust, where the real life experience and insight of users are shared. 

That being open source in nature, it enhances its effect on transparency, user driven innovation, and improvement by contributions from a larger community of developers and users. It also enables the development of advanced models that can fulfill the current and future needs of the platform users.

Finally, the scalability of the solution makes it a model that can be applied to any other college campus or similar community struggling to manage the structure of dining information. By addressing core challenges in navigating through the dining process, this project can go beyond the conceived goal in offering positive impact across multiple situations.
